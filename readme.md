# Tech 258 - Python

### What is Python? What is the history of Python?
Python is a programming language which is known for its simplicity and readability. It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. Guido's goal was to create a language that would be easy to read and understand, with a syntax that emphasises simplicity and clarity.

### Why is Python popular? Why is it particularly popular for DevOps engineers?
Python is popular due to the simplicity of the language, as targeted by Guido. Python is popular amongst DevOps engineers as Python integrates well with a wide range of DevOps tools that are used for automation, configuration management and CI/CD. Python's simplicity also makes it very popular as the language is well-suited for writing automation scripts. 
### What is a virtual environment?
A virtual environment is an isolated environment for Python projects. This is helpful as it prevents conflict whilst ensuring that projects can run independently.
### What is "pip"?
"pip" is the command-line tool that allows you to manage Python via CLI (Command Line Interface). You can use various commands such as:
- Install a Python package `pip install <package>`
- Uninstall a Python package `pip uninstall <package>`
- Show information about a package `pip show <package>`
### What is scripting? How is it different to programming?
Whilst often confused, scripting is not the same as programming. The fundamental difference is that scripting is more so interpreted, rather than compiled. This is because scripting is used for automation. Programming is compiled as opposed to interpreted, as programming consists of creating. 
### What are the base/built-in Python libraries?
Python consists of a plethora of built-in libraries, such as:
- OS - Operating System Interface
- datetime
- math
- random
- collections
- json
### What are some of the most popular external libraries?
Some of the most popular external libraries are as follows:
- NumPy - Used for scientific computing.
- pandas - Used for data manipulation and analysis.
- matplotlib - Used as a plotting library for visualisations in Python.
