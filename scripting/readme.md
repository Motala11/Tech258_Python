# Scripting

## What is scripting?

Scripting refers to the process of writing scripts, which are sequences of instructions or commands that are interpreted or executed by a computer. It is used for efficiency and automation.

## How is it different to programming?
Whilst often confused, scripting is not the same as programming. The fundamental difference is that scripting is more so interpreted, rather than compiled. This is because scripting is used for automation. Programming is compiled as opposed to interpreted, as programming consists of creating.
